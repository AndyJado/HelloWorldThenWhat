# A coding friend

My grandpa picked cotton for a living, he picked them with bare hands and slack season wasn't fun, they stand in a train case for 48 hrs heading north cause there are unpicked cotton, fields and fields but no shelter for labours. they'd dig a hole like Steve in MineCract for bed. And if you know why northern fruits are more sweet, that is how deep the hole he dig.

Were stars able to fill the frame and do they flow like a river? I missed my chance asking. But a blooming cotton seed hull, wrinkle and sharp, which my memory converges to normally, doesn't come off easily without some peasant wisdom. 

May that wisdom pick something like dangling pointers? Here is a friend.

He read his English at 18 and printed `helloWorld` at 25, he don't talk to his father for his entire life but still he unable to rebel parents' will, living is a debt and you don't argue that with our friend. He is a regular masturbater, ''way more efficient'' if we quote his mind. And he codes every chance he can.

He wrote sort of a programme that could run, he open his dusty cantact list and showed it to the one who now works at microsoft and he get a emoji with a thumb up, he returned a :) which seemed to be the end.

How many steps could you make in a blind walk and if you can recall the 'potential stumbling' in the final one, that's how our friend warps up his conversation with almost everyone.

Better not to make a fool out of myself and go play with my own kind.

But where are you my fellow peasant's son.
