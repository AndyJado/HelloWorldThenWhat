I know I am going to be a writer but in no hurry, cause the second task on the schedule is get myself killed. 

I write and I don't publish, I made attempence and I learned my lesson.

At some point, I'll have to publish like I had to write, we'll see.

I've been thinking in English and talking to myself with it for few years. My tongue don't like it but by doing so my mind works somewhere cleaner, and it walks, more gently, rather than rushing. 

"Captain America dick pic"

My mind finish the sentence and nothing happens more than rythms and words, Were I in my native, I just saw it too fast and all those fractions.

I got loads of thoughts on languages but they ain't for talk yet.

I'm currently writing a software motiviated by Chomsky, in a video he answering a biologist , and he said:
"Characteristic use of language is for thought, not for communication. Overwhlemingly, language is internal".

However, What I'm writing now is for communication, and I'am spending much more time reading than writing. I add one line here and I pause, I read the whole script over and let loops. 

I alienate myself so I capture the status you reading it, which feels like being parasitized by a bag of strangers, and I feed them before I feed my son. Or plainly how I put it: I believe I got some genious.

But the software, the app, the iOS app I am writing, serves another purpose, what is then? No, I can't find the fundamental accurate statement yet. 

But the citizen for the app is, the record of the minimal life span one can proceed, which in my proposal, is made of 1 String and 2 Int:

the word you say, life you spend, and time you repeat.
```swift
struct Aword:Hashable, Codable {

    var text: String = ""
    var secondSpent: Int = 0
    var edition: Int = 1
}
```

And all functionality along is there to make the citizen well accommodated. 

Have you ever open a note and wrote about 5 characters and you never open it again yet you let it hang, have you ever had a dialog in some chatting app and you cherish some lines and you had to take a screenshot, those are what I won't call well accommodated.

Q: What you say about Mindmap?
A: Well you pin your accommodation on the map but you are not accomoodated there, it's an accommodation for accommodation ain't it?

Q: All the fuss and turn out you are trying to sell a software?
A: No, I am reading Raymond Carver, it made me wanting to write. 

A writer don't explain, a writer don't answer questions, a writer's work answers itself otherwise he no qulified as a writer.

But yes I'm talking about my app, yes I want to earn from it, I can't help but answer the mindmap question, it's a neccesity and it's fun.Yeah it's not a writer's work anymore but hey, does it make a good letter?
