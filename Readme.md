# hello world, then what?
No, I'm never a software developer, but today is the day I switch all my `print` to `log` .  

~~And the day I realize that MVVM is a somehow a lie and I've been tricked but when I looked at my projects I found out that I'm Okay, I just have a big nasty ObservableObject for the ContentView just like they mark a final class, so, I don't know, should I start learning how to deal with delegates? Nah, I guess my ignorance will save me agin just like today.~~

And the day I got the feeling that I'm getting serious, like a relationship, that moment you find, if you keep doing what you are doing, you get a future out of it. 

And here is to say no to that:

- I don't write code for anyone but myself.
- I won't fix my bugs unless it really bothers me.
- Try everything not to get bothered by those bugs and archive the attemptences.
